## RAPID 2021 - Recent Advances in Power electronics and Industrial Drives

RAPID '21 aims at bringing academicians, professional engineers, research organisations and research scholars on a common platform to share new ideas, experiences and knowledge in emerging areas of power electronics and industrial drives. The conference will ignite the minds of the participants and delegates for undertaking collaborative research for updating technical know-how to stay in tune with the recent advances. The technical programme consists of peer-review paper presentations, key note lectures, presentation by industry professionals and panel discussion.

Organised by Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, NSS College of Engineering Palakkad.
